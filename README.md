# Neural Networks From Scratch

In this repository, I have built a feed forward neural network from scratch.

- This network uses normal gradient decient.
- It uses Cross Entropy loss function and supports activation functions like relu,sigmoid and softmax.
- It is trained on fashion mnist dataset.
